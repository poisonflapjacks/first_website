        <h1 class="title">Hi there! Welcome to my about me</h1>
        <p class="msg">Hi there, looks like you've found my Bio. If you're interested, below is a little bit about my journey to becoming a full-time developer.
            Iâ€™m a first-generation college student putting myself through school by working the odd restaurant job here and there. All of this is in an effort to pursue my Bachelor's in Computer Science with a minor in Mathematics because one day I aspire to have the skills necessary to be part of a team that develops technology that helps the world.
            I have always had a fascination with technology. From the iPhone to the Raspberry Pi, the history of problems arising and creators finding solutions was a story that I never found that I got tired of hearing. To me, there is a primal urge for humans to create beautiful solutions to problems and I felt early on a call to be part of that story. 
            Early in my learning journey, my outlet for creative desire was explored through my math courses in high school. I enjoyed the feeling of being handed a difficult problem and working my way through a solution. I feel that the problem-solving skills learned through math are paramount to all aspects of society. This feeling was so intense that my career plan at that time was to get my degree in teaching so that I could pay it forward and teach math at the high school level. Unfortunately, due to the Covid-19 pandemic, that plan seemed to longer be the best path for me. By the time I had to pick a major, I scrambled and decided that Mechanical Engineering sounded as if it could be a great fit. After struggling to feel at home with that path, I decided it was time for a change. That's when I remembered how much fun I had when I had taken one of the required introductions to programming courses. After this last switch, I do not think I could ever go back.  
            I'm now a Computer Science student who loves my new path. My specific field interests change as I learn more and more about the lack of limitations when it comes to software design. Right now, website design using HTML and CSS is a topic that has my attention, so I'm attempting to learn all that I can by creating new projects that will soon be available on my GitHub. I hope to keep you all updated on my journey. If you have any good reading recommendations, feel free to send them my way.
