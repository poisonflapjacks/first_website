# Personal Website
This website is a long term project to be able to host personal information about my projects and growth as a programmer. 
It will be updated throughout my career as developer. As of now, this website is using 
a single HTML file for the homepage, a CSS file for general style, and has yet to implement any JavaScript functionality.
Plans in the futre involve learning how to use the React framework after I feel more comfortable with only using HTML and CSS.
